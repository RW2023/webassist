# General Questions

## What is WebAssist?
WebAssist is a production-ready chatbot template for Next.js applications that helps developers add AI-powered assistance to their websites without hallucinations.

**Use Case:** Perfect for documentation sites, SaaS products, portfolios, or any website where you want to provide instant answers based on your own content.

**Key Features:**
- Answers are grounded strictly in your MDX/Markdown files (no AI making things up)
- Beautiful, responsive chat widget built with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion
- Smart fallback to a contact form when the bot doesn't know the answer
- Persistent chat history using localStorage
- OpenAI integration for natural language understanding

## How do I get started with WebAssist?
Getting started is quick and easy! Follow these steps:

**Step 1: Clone and Install**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RW2023/webassist.git
cd webassist
npm install
```

**Step 2: Set up your OpenAI API Key**
- Create a `.env.local` file in the project root
- Add your OpenAI API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here`
- Get your key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

**Step 3: Run the development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 and click the chat widget in the bottom-right corner!

## How do I add my own knowledge to the chatbot?
Adding knowledge is as simple as creating Markdown files! Here's how:

**Step 1: Navigate to the content folder**
Go to `src/content/faqs/` in your project

**Step 2: Create a new .mdx file**
You can organize by topic (e.g., `pricing.mdx`, `technical.mdx`, `support.mdx`)

**Step 3: Structure your content with H2 headers**
Each `## Question` becomes a searchable Q&A pair:

```markdown
---
category: Your Category
---

## What is your pricing?
We offer three tiers: Free, Pro ($29/mo), and Enterprise (custom pricing).

## How do I upgrade my account?
Visit your account settings and click "Upgrade Plan".
```

**Step 4: Restart your dev server**
The chatbot will automatically load your new content!

## How can I customize the chatbot's personality and appearance?
You have full control over the bot's identity and look:

**Customize Identity & Behavior:**
Edit `src/config/chatbot.ts` to change:
- Bot name and description
- Welcome message
- System prompt (how the AI should respond)
- Fallback button text (e.g., "Contact Support" → "Contact Dev")
- Intake form copy

**Customize Appearance:**
- **Chat widget colors:** Edit `src/components/chat/ChatWidget.tsx` (look for className props)
- **Chat window styling:** Modify `src/components/chat/ChatWindow.tsx`
- **Form styling:** Update `src/components/chat/IntakeForm.tsx`
- All components use Tailwind CSS classes for easy customization

**Example:** To change the bot's name from "WebAssist" to "MyBot":
```typescript
// src/config/chatbot.ts
export const CHATBOT_CONFIG = {
  name: "MyBot",
  description: "Your personal AI assistant",
  // ... rest of config
};
```
